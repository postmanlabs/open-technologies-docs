API specifications are an essential tool for designing, documenting, and governing APIs. They enable you to define the requirements of your API and describe what it does. Building your APIs consistently with standardized specifications is the first step you can take toward making sure that they are well-designed and easy to use.

The Postman app is designed to support all major API specification formats, including [Web Services Description Language (WSDL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl/), [RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML)](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md), [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html), [GraphQL](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/), and [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md). On top of that, Postman Open Technologies supports the specification formats themselves. As a company, we directly support communities like [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/community), [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/), and [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/#about-our-community).

## About API specification formats

There are a wide variety of API specification formats available, each with its own benefits. For example, [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) prioritizes human readability, making it easy for end users to understand and use your API, while [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md) is optimized for efficient performance. By using a consistent approach and choosing the right specification for your API, you can make sure that the design and development of your API are scalable, efficient, and well-governed.

## The role of API specifications

Specifications play a major role in API standards and governance, contract testing, and the API lifecycle. When you're building or integrating an API, your specification file serves as a [blueprint for your API](https://medium.com/better-practices/api-specifications-d87588ac874). For more information about working with API specification files in Postman, see [Editing an API definition](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/developing-an-api/defining-an-api/) in the Postman Learning Center.

### Standards and governance

API specifications provide a standard language and structure for describing APIs. They make it easier for developers to understand, document, and share the API's features and functions with consumers. When developers adhere to the rules of a specification format for defining things like endpoints, methods, parameters, request and response formats, and authentication methods, the APIs they create are more predictable, user-friendly, and tool-friendly.

### Contract testing

When you want to make sure that your API is working as expected, you can validate the API implementation against the requirements you outlined in the API specification file. Create automated tests that make requests to the API and check that the responses you receive match what is expected. You can use contract tests to validate status codes, data types, and required fields, which are all defined in the API specification file. When the API works as expected, it builds trust between the API producers and consumers.

### Lifecycle

API specifications are useful throughout the API lifecycle. When you're planning and designing an API, you start with the API specification file. Even before development begins, you can use the specification file to outline the API’s structure, endpoints, and request and response formats to make sure all collaborators and stakeholders have a common understanding of the API’s purpose and features.

By adhering to the conventions outlined by the specification format, you can develop an API that is consistent, user-friendly, and integrates with tools. For example, by integrating with tools like [SwaggerUI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) for OpenAPI or [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphiql) for GraphQL, API documentation can be automatically generated and kept up-to-date.

## How Postman supports specifications

Postman provides financial and other resources to creator communities like [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/community), [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/), [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/#about-our-community), and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/community/) to allow them to focus on bringing better tooling to the broader community. Our goal is to make sure developers have the flexibility to work with APIs in any environment or workflow.

As part of our commitment to supporting the growth of open-source projects and promoting innovation and trust within the community, Postman is a member of the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/). Many Postman employees lead Linux Foundation initiatives like the [GraphQL Foundation](https://graphql.org/foundation/), [OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/), [AsyncAPI Initiative](https://www.asyncapi.com/), and the [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) project within the OpenJS Foundation. Postman hosts regular open meetings related to these projects and specifications, some weekly and some monthly, to promote transparency within the community.

## Why Postman supports specifications

With a strong lineup of API specifications, everybody benefits. We can contribute to a more robust ecosystem for the entire community by providing support for a variety of different API development projects. As new use cases for APIs continue to emerge, specification standards are adapting to meet the changing needs of developers and end users. By investing directly in developer communities, we foster innovation and ensure that APIs created today will be relevant and useful for years to come.
